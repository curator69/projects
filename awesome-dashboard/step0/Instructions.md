Hello there, welcome to the first step of the Awesome dashboard tutorial. In this project, we are going to build an awesome looking dashboard with the use of all the CSS basics we have learnt so far. You can find the images and icons in the `assets` folder. We will be using only `HTML5` and `CSS3` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the final design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshots of the final output in desktop and mobile viewports.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Build an awesome looking dashboard with the available images and icons.
2. Make sure your images and icons are well settled into the design.
3. Go through the biolerplate code already built for you, add your custom CSS if you want.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
